# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The main motivator I had for this project was to prove to myself that I can learn new things, and no matter how much I learn, there is always more room to improve. I built this project as a way to itemize my uncoditional love for improvement. Because this website is something tangible, I can always look back on this as a way of reminder to never stop and keep pushing forward. I learned that coding is a real challenge, however, I also learned that I am quite resillient and if I ever need help, i have a great support system behind me.
